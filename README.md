# Linked-lists-v1
This is my begginer "library" for doubly linked lists. 
I started programming few months ago, while also going to college, so the proggras hasn't been the best. That said last week or two I've been writing a lot more and am generaly happy how it's going. 
I avoid ChatGPT entirely with the only exception being asking it to write comments for me on occasion or two.
That's all from me thanks for reading.
